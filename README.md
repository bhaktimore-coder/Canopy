# 🌿 Canopy — Internal Messaging Platform

Canopy is a real-time internal messaging platform built for distributed teams. 
Think of it like your own private Discord — but with a hierarchy that actually 
means something. Admins sit at the top of the canopy, moderators manage the 
branches, and members are the leaves that make it all come alive.

## 🌳 What it does

- **Real-time messaging** — messages appear instantly across all connected clients
- **Role-based access control** — admin, moderator, and member roles each have different powers
- **Multiple chat rooms** — join and switch between channels freely
- **Direct messaging** — private floating DM popups between users
- **Slash commands** — type `/kick username` or `/users` to extend the platform
- **JWT authentication** — secure login and registration system
- **Beautiful UI** — Discord-inspired light green theme with a tree/canopy aesthetic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- pgAdmin (optional but helpful)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd chatapp
```

### 2. Set up the backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Create your `.env` file
Create a file called `.env` inside the `backend` folder:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost/internal_network
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey123
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Set up the database
Open pgAdmin and run the SQL schema:
```sql
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'member');

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  role user_role DEFAULT 'member'
);

CREATE TABLE rooms (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_by INT REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  room_id INT REFERENCES rooms(id),
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 5. Run the backend
```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
✅ Database connected
```

### 6. Open the frontend
Open `frontend/index.html` with Live Server in VS Code
or just drag and drop it into your browser!

## 🌿 The idea behind Canopy

Every organization has a hierarchy — but most chat tools hide it. 
Canopy makes it visible and meaningful. Just like a real canopy, 
the strongest branches (admins) support everything above, 
while the leaves (members) give the whole thing life.

Where every branch connects. 🌳
